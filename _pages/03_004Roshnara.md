<b>The Story of Roshnara</b>
Our chief beautician talks of her village and its beautifully-skinned women. On investigation, we found that they lived near a source of volcanic ash – multani mitti – and used it mixed with herbs, flowers, leaves, petals and ordinary ingredients from the kitchen. Neem, rose petals, a pinch of camphor and haldi, some daal, an almond or two, the ash, all ground together using a sandalwood stem, then mixed with a little curd, and used on the face as a scrub. Quickly prepared and applied, all from material found within reach, it was a boon for the women exposed to the sun the whole day long.

We broke down the recipe to its components and realized they had strong anti-tan, anti-aging and anti-inflammation properties. So was born Roshnara, our rose ubtan, useful for all kinds of skins - young and old - oily, normal and dry.

Today, trained & managed by  DwaarPe, many women use this recipe to create a genuine, natural, wholesome skin care product that is a delight to the senses. DwaarPe works with underprivileged women to help them gain financial independence through means that are compatible with their skills / literacy levels.

In the form of “Roshnara”, we bring to you an astonishingly effective anti-tan & anti ageing product, at an honest price. It is made from pure & homemade ingredients, & powered by a simple, powerful mantra followed by Team DwaarPe:

<b>Description</b>

This ubtan is suitable for daily use for all skin types, even for sensitive skin. This ubtan removes dirt and dead cells from the skin. Reduces inflammation. Smoothens fine lines, leaving it supple, shining and radiant. Regular use will reduce fine lines and/or delay their appearance.
Neem is anti fungal, anti-bacterial, anti-inflammatory, anti-parasitic and analgesic.  It is a boon for people with sensitive or oily, acne prone skin. It helps in getting rid of blackheads, pimples, acne, allergies,  infections and inflammation, including even psoriasis and eczema.
Haldi is well known for its anti-inflammatory and anti-bacterial properties. It also reduces oil secretion by sebaceous glands. That is why it is used to treat acne and other skin infections. It also has a lightening effect, and therefore helps in removing tan and brightening dull skin
Rose petals have anti-bacterial properties that make them excellent for fighting acne. The natural oils in the petals nourish and moisturise the skin, and the sugar in the petals is especially beneficial for sensitive skins. Roses are excellent for skin toning, for all types of skins. The skin is left taut and glowing after using rose water/paste.It also works as a powerful sunblock. It lightens the skin and can help reduce dark under-eye circles.
Almond is a highly dense source of nutrients such as Vitamin E, A, D and B. It is also rich in linoleic acid and oleic acid.  It is absorbed by the skin easily without clogging pores and hence deep nourishes it and cleanses the skin, making it supple,  smooth, youthful,  bright and healthy.
Daal and Multani mitti give volume to the ubtan, and have their own unique properties – the daal has proteins, and the mitti is hugely popular for its healing property against acne and blemishes. It is also very rich in magnesium chloride.
While sandalwood is an anti-bacterial, camphor is a veritable miracle – it reduces pain and itching, can be used against fungal infections, and increases blood flow to the skin.

<b>How To Use</b>
Mix half teaspoon (2gm) of the ubtan in a little yoghurt to make a smooth paste. Spread mixture on face and neck. Let it dry. Rub off with wet fingers, using light circular movements. Lifts off dead cells and leaves the skin soft, supple, clean and bright.
