<b>The Story of Neemrit</b>
As a teen, we would break out in ugly looking pimples and acne, but our buas and mothers and daadis and naanis always had a solution for those eruptions. Interestingly, each had a different but equally effective solution. Some advocated Haldi, yet some preferred Neem. However, every girl with acne longs not only for an acne free skin, but also one that is blemish free and glows with health.

Neemrit was specially created for just this need. It gives not only a pimple free skin but also clears blemishes from earlier acne/ pimple breakouts and clears and brightens the skin to give it a clean, even toned glow.

Today, trained & managed by  DwaarPe, many women use this recipe to create a genuine, natural, wholesome skin care product that has had amazing results. DwaarPe works with underprivileged women to help them gain financial independence through means that are compatible with their skills / literacy levels.

In the form of “Neemrit”, we bring to you an astonishingly effective anti-acne, skin brightening product, at an honest price. It is made from pure & homemade ingredients, & powered by a simple, powerful mantra followed by Team DwaarPe:

<b> “Saccha aur Acchha” </b>

Made without any preservatives, colouring agents or synthetic additives. 

<b>Description</b>
This powder is truly powerful, filled with the best Ayurvedic herbs for treating acne, pimples, skin outbreaks and allergies or minor infections. Fights bacteria. Reduces inflammation. Inhibits active acne and prevents further outbreaks. Regular use reduces old scars, tightens pores and smoothens skin, making it clean, even-toned and bright. Neem is anti-fungal, anti-bacterial, anti-inflammatory, anti-parasitic and analgesic.  It is a boon for people with sensitive or oily, acne prone skin. It helps in getting rid of blackheads, pimples, acne, allergies, infections and inflammation, including even psoriasis and eczema. Haldi is well known for its anti-inflammatory and anti-bacterial properties. It also reduces oil secretion by sebaceous glands. That is why it is used to treat acne and other skin infections. It also has a lightening effect, and therefore helps in removing tan and brightening dull skin.
Orange peel is full of wonderful essential orange oil that softens, brightens and clears the skin. Sesame seeds have an anti-oxidant, deeply nourishing effect. 

Comes with a beautiful reusable glass jar. We pack all our products in glass containers because glass keeps organic natural ingredients fresh longer and doesn’t leach any harmful chemicals into products meant for use on your precious skin.

<b>How To Use</b>
Mix half teaspoon (2gm) of the powder in a little warm water. Keep for 3 to 5 minutes to let the warm water get absorbed and relase the ingredients’  natural juices and oils. Mix half a teaspoon honey to make a smooth paste. Apply mixture on face and neck. Let it dry. Wash off with water, follow with a gentle toner such as Gulab Jal, and a light moisturiser.

Neemrit is safe enough to use daily, however, one or two applications a week are usually enough to bring significant results.  

When used in conjunction with Ashtam Aushadhi, our intensive anti-acne formula, it will help clear up an acne outbreak as well as heal and condition your skin. Regular use will transform your skin with a healthy, clear, bright glow.
