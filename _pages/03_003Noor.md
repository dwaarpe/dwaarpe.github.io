<b>The Story of Noor</b>
We had ubtans for normal skins and for dry skins, and turned our attention to oily skins. Taking the common components from our other ubtans we retained the ones which were anti-acne (anti-bacterial, anti-fungal) anti-tan/blemish. We removed the ones that were themselves too  oil-rich. On scouring our ingredient database, we found that a few of them actually removed oil from skins. We tried a few out, and found that saunf and til made a wonderful combination with our other ingredients – neem, camphor and haldi, rice and daal. This combination cleaned pores of unwanted oil, yet left the skin hydrated – exactly what we wanted.

Today, trained & managed by  DwaarPe, many women use this recipe to create a genuine, natural, wholesome skin care product that is a delight to the senses. DwaarPe works with underprivileged women to help them gain financial independence through means that are compatible with their skills / literacy levels.

In the form of “Noor”, we bring to you an astonishingly effective anti-acne & anti ageing product, at an honest price. It is made from pure & homemade ingredients, & powered by a simple, powerful mantra followed by Team DwaarPe:

<b>Description</b>
This ubtan is suitable for oily to normal skin. Delays aging. Increases blood flow to the skin. It has antispetic and anti-oxidant properties - inhibits the growth of bacteria, soothes inflamed skin, and prevents free-radical damage. It can be used twice to thrice a week. Regular use will tighten pores, prevent acne and make the skin even toned.

Neem is anti fungal, anti-bacterial, anti-inflammatory, anti-parasitic and analgesic.  It is a boon for people with sensitive or oily, acne prone skin. It helps in getting rid of blackheads, pimples, acne, allergies,  infections and inflammation, including even psoriasis and eczema.

Haldi is well known for its anti-inflammatory and anti-bacterial properties. It also reduces oil secretion by sebaceous glands. That is why it is used to treat acne and other skin infections. It also has a lightening effect, and therefore helps in removing tan and brightening dull skin

Fennel/saunf is ideal for toning and hydrating the skin. It keeps the skin faultless, cleanses the skin, fights acne, and delays wrinkles - by removing grime, dirt, excess oil, dead cells and germs from skin pores.

Daal and rice give volume to the ubtan, have proteins, and can act powerfully against tanning. 
Sesame is anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, and anti-viral. It can be used to treat sunburns. It can also absorb oil from the skin and hence ideal for an oily skin.

Camphor is a veritable miracle – it reduces pain and itching, can be used against fungal infections, and increases blood flow to the skin.

<b>How To Use</b>
Mix half teaspoon (2gm) of the ubtan in a little yoghurt to make a smooth paste. Spread mixture on face & neck. Let it dry. Rub off with wet fingers, using light circular movements. Removes dead cells, leaving the skin soft, supple, clean & bright.
