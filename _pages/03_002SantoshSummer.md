<b>The Story of Santosh</b>
“Narangi Summer Bright”, is born out of a Punjabi tradition that has passed down from generation to generation & has been used for centuries to great effect by ladies who never used  any soap or sunscreen or moisturiser in their life & yet enjoyed glowing beautiful skins to a ripe old age. It is a variant of our signature product “Santosh”, modified for use during the hot, humid Indian summer. It is excellent for removing tan, reducing pollution and sun induced inflammation, reducing stickiness while clearing and plumping up the skin.

Today, trained & managed by  DwaarPe, many women use this recipe to create a genuine, natural, wholesome skin care product that is a delight to the senses. DwaarPe works with underprivileged women to help them gain financial independence through means that are compatible with their skills / literacy levels.

In the form of “Santosh”, we bring to you an astonishingly effective skincare product, at an honest price. It is made from pure & homemade ingredients, & powered by a simple, powerful mantra followed by Team DwaarPe:

<b> “Saccha aur Acchha” </b>

<b><i>Nidhi Lauria, Product Advisor</i></b>

Made without any preservatives, colouring agents or synthetic additives. 

<b>Description</b>

This is a mild ubtan, suitable for daily use for dry/mature skins, even for sensitive skin. This ubtan deep-cleanses  by gently lifting dirt from pores. Smoothens fine lines, & plumps up the skin, leaving it shining & radiant. Regular use will reduce fine lines &/or delay their appearance.

Narangi peel is a natural wonder that is full of antioxidant Vitamin C that protects the skin from free radical damage. It inhibits acne, hydrates dry skin, prevents oxidative stress on skin cells.

Masoor Dal and rice form a powerful combo to exfoliate the skin, tighten the pores, brighten your skin, and remove tan. 

Cinnamon is a powerful healing agent, a strongly anti-fungal & anti-bacterial, very effective for treating Acne, pimples & blemishes. It also removes dead cells, reduces dryness & restore shine & suppleness to the skin.

Clove is a very strong anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, antibacterial. Clove oil is said to be more anti-oxidant than any other essential oil. Hence it is used to treat acne, cuts, rashes, blemishes, scars & for rejuvenating mature skin from the inside.

This mask will cleanse the skin, soften it, nourish and make it oil-free to prevent acne.
