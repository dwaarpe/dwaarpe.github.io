<b>The Story of Santosh</b>
“Santosh”,  the signature product of DwaarPe, is born out of a Punjabi tradition that has passed down from generation to generation & has been used for centuries to great effect by ladies who never used  any soap or sunscreen or moisturiser in their life & yet enjoyed glowing beautiful skins to a ripe old age. 

The recipe was taught to me by my mother, Santosh.

Today, trained & managed by  DwaarPe, many women use this recipe to create a genuine, natural, wholesome skin care product that is a delight to the senses. DwaarPe works with underprivileged women to help them gain financial independence through means that are compatible with their skills / literacy levels.

In the form of “Santosh”, we bring to you an astonishingly effective beauty & anti ageing product, at an honest price. It is made from pure & homemade ingredients, & powered by a simple, powerful mantra followed by Team DwaarPe:

<b> “Saccha aur Acchha” </b>
