<b>The Story of Ashtam Aushadhi</b>
As a teen, we would break out in ugly looking pimples and acne, but our buas and mothers and daadis and naanis always had a solution for those eruptions. Interestingly, each had a different but equally effective solution. Some advocated Haldi, others swore by Amla, yet some others by Neem. We used whatever was at hand. Later, when our own children were growing up, we started mixing multiple ingredients, and it worked quite well. We finally settled on the eight that occurred most often in all the tales we had heard from our elders. A formula hand-created using the wisdom gleaned from “old wives’ tales”.

Today, trained & managed by  DwaarPe, many women use this recipe to create a genuine, natural, wholesome skin care product that is a wondrous Aushadhi. DwaarPe works with underprivileged women to help them gain financial independence through means that are compatible with their skills / literacy levels.

In the form of “Ashtam Aushadhi”, we bring to you an astonishingly effective anti-acne, anti-pimple product, at an honest price. It is made from pure & homemade ingredients, & powered by a simple, powerful mantra followed by Team DwaarPe:

Inhibits active acne and prevents further outbreaks. Regular use reduces old scars, tightens pores and smoothens skin, making it clean, even-toned and bright.
