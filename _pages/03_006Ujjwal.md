<b>The Story of Ujjwal</b>
As children, we would watch in fascination as the ladies in the house would get ready for a wedding or a celebration. Among the many rituals - of tying sarees, selecting bangles, and applying kohl - one stood out. It was the grinding together of almonds and rose petals with milk, and then applying the paste on their faces, leaving it for a few minutes. We would be wonderstruck when they would emerge glowing ethereally after this treatment. The aroma of the Indian Rose would fill the air, and for us parties became inextricably linked with this heady fragrance. At DwaarPe, we added one more component – Ashwagandha – and so was born our insta-glow pre-party pack, the Ujjwala.

Today, trained & managed by  DwaarPe, many women use this recipe to create a genuine, natural, wholesome skin care product that is a delight to the senses. DwaarPe works with less privileged women, helps them gain financial independence using means compatible with their skills/literacy levels.

In the form of “Ujjwal”, we bring to you an astonishingly effective beauty pre-party pack, at an honest price. It is made from pure & homemade ingredients, & powered by a simple, powerful mantra followed by Team DwaarPe:
