---

We are a social entrepreneurship startup. We started some years back by funding the education of our maids and girls in our vicinity, getting a trained teacher to come and teach them for 2-3 hours daily. 
Millions of girls are stuck at being maids at homes, unable to break out from a life of drudgery. The only escape is literacy and/or acquiring new skills. We aim to provide girls new skills - starting with "Beauty Services". In addition, we help them deploy those skills, in real-life customer service at homes. Beauty Services, for women, and by women, at reasonable costs. 
<p>Our <a href="/Mission/">Mission</a> - Financial Inclusion for the less privileged.</p>

Our prices are significantly below the market (parlors). We provide service in the safety and privacy of your own home. With material that you can see for yourself, or material that you yourself have. At your convenience, your timing. No hassles of driving or parking.

We have special packages for the elderly, for babies (massages), for brides-to-be. for mothers-to-be, and for new mothers.
