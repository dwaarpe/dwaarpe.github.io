We are a social entrepreneurship startup. We started some years back by funding the education of our maids and girls in our vicinity, getting a trained teacher to come and teach them for 2-3 hours daily. Some of the women/girls improved rapidly, others more slowly. But all of them became literate, and started dreaming of getting to class 10 and beyond.

But they were still working as maids at home. The path (through literacy and school graduation) is a long one. And millions of girls are stuck there, unable to break out from a life of drudgery. 

The only other escape is acquiring new skills. We aim to provide girls new skills - starting with "Beauty Services". But that training is just the first step, and inadequate in itself. At the maximum, their employers would use that service and pay them a little extra for it - something we saw in the neighborhood. Well meaning, but inadequate. What we aimed at was more ambitious - help them deploy those new skills and earn substantially more.

So was born DwaarPe - a platform for women and girls (to begin with) to deploy skills in a commercially meaningful environment - real-life customer service at homes. Beauty Services, for women, and by women, at reasonable costs. 

<p>Our Mission - Financial inclusion and independence for the less privileged in India, specially women and girls.</p>

DwaarPe provides Facials, Waxing, Manicure, Pedicure, Massage, Bleaching, Streaking, Threading, Hair Coloring at home.

Our prices are significantly below the market (parlors). We provide service in the safety and privacy of your own home. With material that you can see for yourself, or material that you yourself have. At your convenience, your timing. No hassles of driving or parking.

We have special packages for the elderly, for babies (massages), for brides-to-be. for mothers-to-be, and for new mothers.

Our servers have undergone scores of hours of training and are pleasant, friendly and competent.

Our servers are women from poor or under-privileged backgrounds, trained by us to enable them to earn more and be financially independent.

Charles Handy, one of the foremost management thinkers of the twentieth century, said this – “Companies that survive longest are the ones that work out what they uniquely can give to the world — not just growth or money but their excellence, their respect for others, or their ability to make people happy. Some call those things a soul”.

DwaarPe is about soul!!
