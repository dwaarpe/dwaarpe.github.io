Our Mission - Financial inclusion for the less privileged. 
</p>
<p>
Our Vision - We started small, with just five girls, training them on beauty services. We aim to take that to ten trainees, then a hundred, and beyond.

</p>
<p>
Our Strategy - Train and deploy.  
We believe that just training someone is not enough. We aim to train people on various skills, and then help them earn a living using those skill.
