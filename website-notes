https://www.taniarascia.com/make-a-static-website-with-jekyll/

- Todo:
        * Populate services pages with rates.
				* Add nav bar back in.
				* Make it possible to use markdown instead of raw HTML for
          full-width images with floating text.
				* Communicate that our Ayurveda products are the main USP but
          still optional.
			  * Write a document that allows Anya, Manu or Nidhi to push
          changes and deploy.
				* Instagram link at bottom
				* add a plugin for payment and appointments?????

- Price range
  - Main value-add is ayurvedic products and materials: Premium
    handcrafted organic products from years of tradition

- Must communicate: it's service AND the associated material

- Not just a service provider, but human warmth

- Like family: foot rub, knee rub, taking care of crying kid, lice
  removal

- Later we should also consider straight up sales of the materials
