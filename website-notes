- Communicate location much more clearly: Delhi, Noida, Gurgaon,
  Faridabad, Ghaziabad

- It's AT YOUR HOME

- Price range
  - Main value-add is ayurvedic products and materials: Premium
    handcrafted organic products from years of tradition

- Must communicate: it's service AND the associated material

- Not just a service provider, but human warmth

- Like family: foot rub, knee rub, taking care of crying kid, lice
  removal

- Later we should also consider straight up sales of the materials

- Todo:
        * Populate services pages with rates.
				* It's ugly.
				  - Can we do full-page photographs wih floating text? Search
            for examples of this done well. How do they manage to keep
            text legible?
					- Instead or in addition: slideshow of pictures
				* Fix: Nav bar at top disappears when window is resized.
				* Fix: Nav bar is too tall.
				* Fix: Nav bar links are too small, extend past nav bar
          background on right, have too much space between them, and
          too much space after the logo.
				* Fix: images are too wide, and different widths.
				* Fix: Weird spacing on left column but not on right.
				* Make dwaarpe github account, push website.
				* Can dwaarpe.com transparently point to dwaarpe.github.io? If
          so, deployment is easy and hosting is free.
			  * Write a document that allows Anya, Manu or Nidhi to push
          changes and deploy.
				* Instagram link at bottom
				* add a plugin for payment and appointments?????
